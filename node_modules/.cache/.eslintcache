I have successfully completed my Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering under the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. Being a graduate student with four years of research, project, and academic study at an international university I have developed a strong interest in CyberSecurity, Data Science, Software Development, and Software Testing.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p className=\"a-desc\">\r\n          In the early years of my bachelor's life, I was introduced to android app development. With growing interest, I worked on a few Android apps which provide solutions to some major daily issues in our life. After app development, I got to work with ReactIS and made some web applications using it.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p className=\"a-desc\">\r\n          After working with various software architectures I have developed my interest in microservices architecture. Therefore in my professional endeavor, I completed my Internship at KloverCloud BD Ltd. where they use a microservices architecture and provide the customer with PAAS service. During my internship, I got to work with Backend development, Software testing, and Technical report writing. I learned a lot from them which helped me to understand a lot about professional life.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p className=\"a-desc\">\r\n          During my 1st undergrad research, I worked on the enhancement of different low-light images using Histogram Equalization (HE) and Illumination Adjustment. I enjoyed a lot working on digital image processing and want to learn and work on it more with data science in the future. However, for my undergrad thesis, I desired to get involved with CyberSecurity. We scanned Bangladeshi educational institutional websites using two scanning tools the analyzed the report and case to conclude that the websites are a lot vulnerable. This research motivated me to further study work with automated vulnerability detection and attack prevention on different platforms.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p className=\"a-desc\">\r\n          I became an executive member of the IUT career and business society and successfully ran many fests and contests since I always liked participating in various extracurricular activities and improving my leadership abilities. I also participated in Pioneers Intern and was a finalist in the business case concept contests BUP Techsergeon and Business Case Competition IUT ICT Fest 2019. Moreover, I participated in a few volunteer projects and was a key player on team Zero. During the Covid crisis, we used to collect money and provide food and other necessities to those in need. I also enjoy reading, watching movies and television shows, and traveling.\r\n        </p>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default About;\r\n","D:\\New folder\\Portfolio\\src\\components\\contact\\Contact.jsx",["37","38","39","40"],"import \"./contact.css\";\r\nimport Github from \"../../img/Github.png\";\r\nimport Linkedin from \"../../img/Linkedin.png\";\r\nimport Phone from \"../../img/phone.png\";\r\nimport Email from \"../../img/email.png\";\r\nimport Address from \"../../img/address.png\";\r\nimport contact from \"../../img/contact.png\";\r\nimport { useContext, useRef, useState } from \"react\";\r\nimport { ThemeContext } from \"../../context\";\r\n\r\nconst Contact = () => {\r\n  const formRef = useRef();\r\n  const [done, setDone] = useState(false)\r\n  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);\r\n  const darkMode = theme.state.darkMode;\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    <div className=\"c\">\r\n      <div className=\"c-bg\">\r\n        <div className=\"c-wrapper\">\r\n          <div className=\"c-centre\">\r\n            <h1 className=\"c-title\">Find Me!</h1>\r\n            <div className=\"c-info\">\r\n              <div className=\"c-info-item\">\r\n              <img className=\"c-icon\" src={Github} alt=\"\" />\r\n                <a\r\n                  className=\"c-link\"\r\n                  href=\"https://github.com/afiarodoshe\"\r\n                  target=\"_blank\"\r\n                  rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\r\n                >\r\n                  Afia Muntakim\r\n                </a>\r\n              </div>\r\n              <div className=\"c-info-item\">\r\n              <img className=\"c-icon\" src={Linkedin} alt=\"\" />\r\n                <a\r\n                  className=\"c-link\"\r\n                  href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/afia-muntakim/\"\r\n                  target=\"_blank\"\r\n                  rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\r\n                >\r\n                  Afia Muntakim\r\n                </a>\r\n              </div>\r\n              <div className=\"c-info-item\">\r\n                <img src={Phone} alt=\"\" className=\"c-icon\" />\r\n                +8801730890871\r\n              </div>\r\n              <div className=\"c-info-item\">\r\n                <img className=\"c-icon\" src={Email} alt=\"\" />\r\n                afiamuntakim@iut-dhaka.edu\r\n              </div>\r\n              <div className=\"c-info-item\">\r\n                <img className=\"c-icon\" src={Address} alt=\"\" />\r\n                W/15-A, Rajshahi University, Rajshahi\r\n              </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n          </div>\r\n          <div className=\"c-right\">\r\n            <p className=\"c-desc\">\r\n\r\n            </p>\r\n          </div>\r\n          <div className=\"c-img\">\r\n            <img className=\"c-right1\" src={contact} alt=\"\" />\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default Contact;\r\n","D:\\New folder\\Portfolio\\src\\components\\product\\Product.jsx",[],"D:\\New folder\\Portfolio\\src\\components\\intro\\Intro.jsx",[],"D:\\New folder\\Portfolio\\src\\components\\toggle\\Toggle.jsx",[],{"ruleId":"41","severity":1,"message":"42","line":2,"column":8,"nodeType":"43","messageId":"44","endLine":2,"endColumn":16},{"ruleId":"41","severity":1,"message":"45","line":12,"column":9,"nodeType":"43","messageId":"44","endLine":12,"endColumn":16},{"ruleId":"41","severity":1,"message":"46","line":13,"column":10,"nodeType":"43","messageId":"44","endLine":13,"endColumn":14},{"ruleId":"41","severity":1,"message":"47","line":13,"column":16,"nodeType":"43","messageId":"44","endLine":13,"endColumn":23},{"ruleId":"41","severity":1,"message":"48","line":15,"column":9,"nodeType":"43","messageId":"44","endLine":15,"endColumn":17},"no-unused-vars","'Engineer' is defined but never used.","Identifier","unusedVar","'formRef' is assigned a value but never used.","'done' is assigned a value but never used.","'setDone' is assigned a value but never used.","'darkMode' is assigned a value but never used."]
