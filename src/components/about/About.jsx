          I am a fresh graduate from the Islamic University of Technology. I have successfully completed my Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering under the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. Being a graduate student with four years of research, project, and academic study at an international university I have developed a strong interest in CyberSecurity, Data Science, Software Development, and Software Testing.

          In the early years of my bachelor's life, I was introduced to android app development. With growing interest, I worked on a few Android apps which provide solutions to some major daily issues in our life. After app development, I got to work with ReactIS and made some web applications using it.

          After working with various software architectures I have developed my interest in microservices architecture. Therefore in my professional endeavor, I completed my Internship at KloverCloud BD Ltd. where they use a microservices architecture and provide the customer with PAAS service. During my internship, I got to work with Backend development, Software testing, and Technical report writing. I learned a lot from them which helped me to understand a lot about professional life.

          During my 1st undergrad research, I worked on the enhancement of different low-light images using Histogram Equalization (HE) and Illumination Adjustment. I enjoyed a lot working on digital image processing and want to learn and work on it more with data science in the future. However, for my undergrad thesis, I desired to get involved with CyberSecurity. We scanned Bangladeshi educational institutional websites using two scanning tools the analyzed the report and case to conclude that the websites are a lot vulnerable. This research motivated me to further study work with automated vulnerability detection and attack prevention on different platforms.

          I became an executive member of the IUT career and business society and successfully ran many fests and contests since I always liked participating in various extracurricular activities and improving my leadership abilities. I also participated in Pioneers Intern and was a finalist in the business case concept contests BUP Techsergeon and Business Case Competition IUT ICT Fest 2019. Moreover, I participated in a few volunteer projects and was a key player on team Zero. During the Covid crisis, we used to collect money and provide food and other necessities to those in need. I also enjoy reading, watching movies and television shows, and traveling.
